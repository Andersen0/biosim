# The BioSim project - june 2021
### Developers: Olav Vikøren Espenes & Tage Andersen

This GitLab project contains modules, with associated tests, and sample scripts with simulations of the ecosystem on 
Rossumøya. The project has been part of the assessment in the course INF200 which deals with programming in Pycharm with python as 
the programming language. Rossumøya consists of four different landscape types and two different animal species. 
The interaction between the various modules in the BisSim project simulates annual cycles on the island, which include eating, procreation, migration, aging and death. The simulation is visualized through various plotting tools from Matplotlib.
